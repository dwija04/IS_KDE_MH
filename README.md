# IS_KDE_MH

The file 'poisson_regression_functions.R' is directly taken from the code of the paper "Importance Sampling using Moreau Yosida envelopes". It requires all the functions to run the sampler. The file 'poisson_regression.R' contains code which uses the samples to get importance sampling KDE estimators discussed in the report.
